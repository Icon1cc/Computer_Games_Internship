## Pre-production Phase

This phase includes defining the game's scope, the required assets, the game's functionalities, and the project's timeframe.

## Learning Phase

You will need to understand the basics of Unity and C# before you can start the development. Unity is the game engine you'll be using, and C# is the scripting language used to define game behavior.

## Development Phase

This is the core phase of the project where you'll create your game. It includes creating your assets (or sourcing them), implementing your functionality, and testing your game.

## Polishing Phase

After your game is functionally complete, you'll likely need to spend some time polishing it. This can include tweaking gameplay, fixing bugs, improving graphics, and optimizing performance.

## Release Phase

Once you're happy with your game, it's time to release it. This could involve publishing it to a platform like the Unity Asset Store, Google Play, or Apple's App Store.

## Trello Board

We use a Trello board to manage the development process. Here are the list names and their respective card names:

## Additional Resources

Please note that this is a high-level overview. Each step would require a detailed understanding and learning depending on the complexity of the game. There are many online tutorials, documentation, and courses available to help you with each step of the game development process. Game development can be a complex process, but it's also a lot of fun and very rewarding.
